## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Julius KrÃ¼ger Madsen, and I'm a software development student at Copenhagen Business Academy. In my free time i mostly code in Python, but I also have experience with a variety of other programming languages and technologies, including :

- Java 
- JavaScript 
- React 
- TypeScript 
- Angular 
- Lua
- C# 
- HTML/CSS 
- T-SQL 
- Jupyter Notebooks 

Currently, my GitHub profile primarily features school projects, but I plan on adding more unique and interesting projects soon. My goal is to showcase my skills and experience as a developer, and to contribute to the open-source community.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julius-kruger/)!
